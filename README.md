# RPG_Database

This database is aimed to be simple enough to show my understanding of SQL.

Make sure to read the comments.

It currently stores the SQL commands in text files.

makedb.text	creates the table structure
addcontent.text	adds the content based on the table structure

I have kept to a naming scheme to make SQL commands human readable.

I have tried to avoid using (too) platform specific SQL commands. I am not too bothered about which platforms it would work on as it would only require minor changes to the syntax.
